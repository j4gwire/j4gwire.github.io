Hey there! I'm **Jason**, A *developer* who's passionate about ~~breaking things~~ building secure applications. You can check out my [latest projects on GitHub](https://github.com/j4gwire) or browse around this page to learn more about what I do.

I've been on this coding journey for a while now, and it's been quite the ride. Started with simple HTML pages and now I'm diving deep into cybersecurity and building tools that actually matter.

# About Me

I'm based in California and spend my days (and nights) working on everything from web applications to security tools. GitHub has been my home for version control and collaboration, letting me work on projects with people from anywhere in the world.

## My Development Philosophy

> This might sound cheesy, but I truly believe this:
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

That's basically been my entire self-taught journey in a nutshell.

### What I'm Currently Working On

```javascript
// My current focus areas in code form
const currentFocus = {
  primary: ["Web Development", "Cybersecurity", "OSINT"],
  learning: ["Cloud Security", "DevSecOps", "Advanced Python"],
  tools: ["Docker", "AWS", "Burp Suite", "Custom Scripts"],
  nextGoal: "Cybersecurity Consulting Firm"
};

function dailyRoutine() {
  return "Code, learn, secure, repeat";
}
```

```python
# My typical project workflow
projects = ["web_apps", "security_tools", "osint_scripts"]

for project in projects:
    while not project.is_perfect():
        project.code()
        project.test()
        project.break_things()
        project.fix_things()
        project.learn_something_new()
```

#### The Skills I've Picked Up

*   **Frontend Development** - Making things look good and work smoothly
*   **Backend Development** - The behind-the-scenes magic that makes everything function
*   **Cybersecurity** - Because someone has to keep the bad guys out
*   **OSINT** - Ethical information gathering and research

##### My Go-To Technologies

1.  **Python** - For automation, security tools, and when I need to get stuff done fast
2.  **JavaScript** - Frontend magic and Node.js backend work
3.  **PHP** - Still love it for web development, fight me
4.  **Linux/Bash** - Because the command line is where the real work happens

###### Current Project Status

| Project | Language | Status | What It Does |
|:--------|:---------|:-------|:-------------|
| CloudRip | Python | ðŸŸ¢ Active | Designed to bypass Cloudflare protection and help discover the real IP addresses of domains by enumerating subdomains. |
| SentinelIP | Golang | ðŸŸ¡ In Development | Real-time IP threat detection service with proxy & VPN detection and IP threat intelligence. |
| DataHawk | Python | ðŸŸ¢ Active | OSINT tool for scraping websites to identify sensitive information. |
| Cheat Sheets | Markdown | ðŸ”´ Incomplete | A growing collection of cheat sheets covering webdev, cybersecurity, and IT for quick reference and learning. |

### Here's what drives me every day

* * *

### My favorite development tools:

*   **VS Code** - Where the magic happens
*   **Git** - Because version control saves lives
*   **Docker** - Containers make everything easier
*   **Burp Suite** - For when I need to test security

### And my learning process usually goes like this:

1.  Find something I don't understand
2.  Break it down into smaller pieces
3.  Build something with it
4.  Break that something
5.  Fix it and understand why it broke

### My approach to different areas:

- **Web Development**
  - Start with the user experience
  - Make it secure from day one
    - Input validation everywhere
    - Proper authentication flows
- **Cybersecurity**
  - Think like an attacker
  - Build defenses accordingly
  - Always assume breach mentality
- **OSINT**
  - Stay ethical and legal
  - Document everything
  - Respect privacy boundaries

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this: const reallyLongVariableNameThatGoesOnForever = "Sometimes you encounter code like this in the wild and you just have to deal with horizontal scrolling because the developer didn't think about line length limits when they were writing their variable names and string literals.";
```

Thanks for taking the time to check out my page! Whether you're here to collaborate, learn, or just browse around, I hope you found something interesting. Feel free to reach out through GitHub if you want to chat about development, security, or anything tech-related.

Keep coding, stay curious, and remember - every expert was once a beginner.
